# movienite
Movienite is a golang based API for storing information about movies. Features include a REST API to store information about movies and a user sign up flow. This project uses Golang for the REST API and PostgreSQL for the database.

# Motivation
This repo is based on the book [Lets go Further](https://lets-go-further.alexedwards.net/) by Alex Edwards as a learning project. It was 100% handcoded and worked through, with various refactorings to put my own twist on some sections of code.
